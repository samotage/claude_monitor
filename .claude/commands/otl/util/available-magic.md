# /available-magic Command

**Goal:** Help the user understand what skills and plugins are available beyond OTL commands.

**Command name:** `/available-magic`

---

## Prompt

You are helping me discover what "magic" (skills and plugins) is available in this Claude Code session.

**Context:** Claude Code has many skills and plugins available, but it's hard to know what's there. This command surfaces everything EXCEPT the OTL commands (which I already know about since they're my own).

---

## 1. Gather Available Magic

**Run in parallel:**

1. Run `claude plugin list` to get installed plugins
2. Parse the available skills from the Skill tool's registry (you have access to this in your system prompt)

---

## 2. Filter and Categorize

**Exclude:** Any skill starting with `otl:` (these are Otage Labs commands, already known)

**Group remaining skills by module:**

- `openspec:*` - OpenSpec change management
- `bmad:cis:*` - Creative Innovation Suite
- `bmad:bmb:*` - BMAD Module Builder
- `bmad:bmm:*` - BMAD Method Module
- `bmad:core:*` - Core BMAD utilities
- `frontend-design:*` - Frontend design generation
- Any other skill modules found

---

### Plugins Section

- The bmad:* skills come from the BMAD framework for AI-assisted development
- OpenSpec is for structured change management in codebases
