Before we begin any work, please read and understand the project configuration files. This will help you work effectively within the established guidelines.

**Read these files in order:**

1. `CLAUDE.md` - Project overview, tech stack, commands, and architecture
2. `.claude/settings.json` - Pre-approved permissions (what you can run without asking)
3. `.claude/settings.local.json` - Additional local permissions
4. `.claude/rules/ai-guardrails.md` - Behavioral rules and guidelines

After reading, please confirm:
- You understand what this project does
- You know which commands are pre-approved
- You understand the guardrails (especially around config changes, pip, and git)

Then summarize what you learned and wait for my instructions.
