# state files created by the claude-monitor wrapper script.

projects:
  # Example projects - replace with your own
  - name: "my-project"
    path: "/Users/yourname/dev/my-project"

  - name: "another-project"
    path: "/Users/yourname/dev/another-project"

# How often to refresh the dashboard (in seconds)
# Lower values = more responsive but more CPU usage

# Increase if focus isn't working reliably
iterm_focus_delay: 0.1
